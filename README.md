# Burger Time

## General Overview

This homework assignment created a burger logger using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!), which is hosted using Heroku.

## Instructions

1. Add a new burger using the "add burger" input field located at the bottom of the page. It should then populate the new burger in the section "Burgers to Devour."
2. Select a burger in the "Burgers to Devour" section and click on the "Devour it" button, the burger will then move to the "Devoured" section.
3. Select a burger in the "Devoured" section and click the "Send it Back" button, the burger should then move back to the "Burgers to Devour" section.
